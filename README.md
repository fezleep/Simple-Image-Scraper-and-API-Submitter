# Simple-Image-Scraper-and-API-Submitter
I made a Python script that:  Downloads an image from a link  Converts it to base64  Sends it to an AI inference API using the model microsoft-florence-2-large  Then sends the response to another URL to submit  It uses requests, base64, and prints the status while running. If anything goes wrong, it stops the script.
